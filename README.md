# Qiskit One Day: Max-Cut QAOA

A minimal end-to-end implementation of the Max-Cut problem using QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) with Qiskit.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main script to generate a graph, solve it with both classical brute force and QAOA, and save results:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

Results will be saved in the `results/` directory as `results.json` and `results.csv`.
